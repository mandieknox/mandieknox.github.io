<div id="about"><p id="slogan">"I do some web design." - Peter Parker</p>

<p>Anything that involves a computer and a fine eye is fine by me,<br> which is why I chose to pursue web design as a career. <br>These days, a good website can be a valuable asset to any kind of business. <br>The web is a particularly good place for local professionals and musicians to gain exposure.<br> I aim to be the bridge between talent and consumer, <br>creating appealing and functional sites for up-and-coming bands and artists alike.</p>
